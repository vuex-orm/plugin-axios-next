# Model

Vuex ORM Axios adds a few properties and methods to the Model object.

## Static Properties

### axios

- **`static axios: AxiosInstance | null`**

  The axios isntance which was installed during the plugin installation process. Vuex ORM Axios adds a few properties and methods to the Model object. Vuex ORM Axios will use this Axios instance to perform any HTTP request.

  Usually, this property will not become `null`. However, there's a case where you may need to add Axios instance manually, for example, when using Vuex ORM Axios with Nuxt.js. In that case, this property will temporarily be `null`.

### globalApiConfig

- **`globalApiConfig: GlobalConfig`**

  The property that holds global configuration. The value will be set automatically during the plugin installation process. **Do not mutate this property manually**.

- **`apiConfig: Config | null`**

  The property that defines the Model configuration for the API call.

## Static Methods

### setAxios

- **`static setAxios(axios: AxiosInstance): void`**

  The method to set the Axios instance manually. Usually, you don't have to call this method yourself; however, you might need to use this method to set Axios instance properly in some situations. Please [refer here](../guide/getting-started.html#nuxt-js-integration) for more detail.

### api

- **`static api(): Request`**

  This method is going to return a new Request instance. A request instance is the wrapper for Axios, and it's used to perform any API request.

  ```js
  User.api().get('/api/users')
  ```
