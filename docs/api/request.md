# Request

The Request object is the foundation for the Vuex ORM Axios, and you can call many methods to perform an api request. You can obtain a Request instance by `api` method on the Model.

```js
const request = User.api()
```

Usually, you could just call Request methods directly by method chaining.

```js
User.api().get()
```

## Constructor

- **``constructor(model: typeof Model)``**

  Request instances require the Model class to be passed to the constructor. It's automatically done when obtaining the Request object through `Model.api()` method. Alternatively,  you could manually construct Request object your self.

  ```js
  // This is equivalent to...
  const request = new Request(User)

  // This.
  const request = User.api()
  ```
